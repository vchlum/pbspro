 * @par Synopsis:
 *	int disrsi(int stream, int *retval)
 *
 *	Gets a Data-is-Strings signed integer from <stream>, converts it into
 *	an int and returns it.
 *
 *	This format for character strings representing signed integers can best
 *	be understood through the decoding algorithm:
 *
 *	1. Initialize the digit count to 1.
 *
 *	2. Read the next digit; if it is a sign, go to step (4).
 *
 *	3. Decode a new count from the digit decoded in step (2) and the next
 *	   count - 1 digits; repeat step (2).
 *
 *	4. Decode the next count digits as the magnitude of the signed integer.
 *
 *	*<retval> gets DIS_SUCCESS if everything works well.  It gets an error
 *	code otherwise.  In case of an error, the <stream> character pointer is
 *	reset, making it possible to retry with some other conversion strategy.
