 * @par Synopsis:
 *	char *disrcs(int stream, size_t *nchars, int *retval)
 *
 *	Gets a Data-is-Strings character string from <stream> and converts it
 *	into a counted string, returns a pointer to it, and puts the character
 *	count into *<nchars>.  The character string in <stream> consists of an
 *	unsigned integer, followed by a number of characters determined by the
 *	unsigned integer.
 *
 *	The data returned has an NULL byte appended to the end in case the
 *	calling program wishes to treat it as a NULL terminated string.
 *	This means the space allocated for the data is one byte larger than
 *	indicated by the count.
 *
 *	*<retval> gets DIS_SUCCESS if everything works well.  It gets an error
 *	code otherwise.  In case of an error, the <stream> character pointer is
 *	reset, making it possible to retry with some other conversion strategy.
 *	In case of an error, disrcs returns NULL and <nchars> is set to 0.
