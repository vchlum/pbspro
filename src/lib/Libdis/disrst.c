 * @par Synopsis:
 *	char *disrst(int stream, int *retval)
 *
 *	Gets a Data-is-Strings character string from <stream> and converts it
 *	into a null-terminated string, and returns a pointer to the result.  The
 *	character string in <stream> consists of an unsigned integer, followed
 *	by a number of characters determined by the unsigned integer.
 *
 *	*<retval> gets DIS_SUCCESS if everything works well.  It gets an error
 *	code otherwise.  In case of an error, the <stream> character pointer is
 *	reset, making it possible to retry with some other conversion strategy.
 *	In case of an error, the return value is NULL.
